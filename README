Desc:	Deploys Java web applications to a local or remote Apache Tomcat server
	It takes all source and auxilliary file in a directory (should have a flat 
	structure), creates a deployment descriptor file, compiles all Java class 
	files, creates a WAR archive and deploys them to the local or remote server.
	It will also organize all supporting files such as image, javascript and 
	resource jars, updating the relative path references to them within your 
	source code.

	Tested on FreeBSD and Debian. Not tested extensively.

	

Usage: ./tomcat_deploy [-g] [-t path/to/tomcat/root ] [path/to/files ] 
 	
	-g or --graphical:	optional flag to run in graphical mode (requires zenity)
	-t or --tomcat-home: 	use this flag to specify the path to the Tomcat Home 
				directory. If the server is on a remote host precede the
				path name with the hostname or ip address followed by a 
				colon and the path i.e "<hostname>:<path>"
